# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Site link

The site is live on [https://www.seanisnotseen.com](https://www.seanisnotseen.com) or [https://www.seanisnotseen.com/react_portfolio_site/](https://www.seanisnotseen.com/react_portfolio_site/). 

Currently it is running off github pages, but there will be an updated fork of this project that will be using NextJS in the future :)
